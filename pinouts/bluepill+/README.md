# STM32F103C8T6 devboard pinout

NB!: this is unfinished illustration

A pinout diagram for a STM32F103C8T6-based development board designed by [WeAct Studio](https://github.com/WeActTC) (or, as they refer the board: [BluePill+]((https://github.com/WeActTC/BluePill-Plus)))

This illustration is a completely re-created version of a pinout diagram made by [Rasmus Friis Kjeldsen](http://reblag.dk/stm32/), but I added new locations of:
- buttons / LED
- onboard flash IC (if soldered)
- current and voltage limitations (based on datasheets for parts in schematics)
- corresponding Arduino pins as specified [here](https://www.hackster.io/VE1DX/use-an-stm32f103c8t6-blue-pill-with-the-arduino-ide-11bd1c).
